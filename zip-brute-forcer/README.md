## A small script to brute force passwords of zip files.
## Run the script using python3 at the command line and pass it the name of the zip file you want to crack and wordlist file. 
## Example Usage: ./zip-brute-forcer.py secret.zip /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt
## I have provided 3 zip files for you to give the tool a test run :)
